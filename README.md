# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge we had to plot earthquakes from the last 7 days using data from USGS. Each marker shows the location of an earthquake, along with identifying information (coordinates). 
The color of the marker indicates the depth of the earthquake, while the size of the marker indicates the magnitude of the earthquake.

All code used was taken from class activities.
